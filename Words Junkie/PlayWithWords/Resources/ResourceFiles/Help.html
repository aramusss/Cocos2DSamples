<h3><FONT FACE="Marker Felt" COLOR="white">Rules</FONT></h3>
    
<FONT FACE="Marker Felt"  SIZE="3" COLOR="white">
<p>Points for each word formed are awarded by squaring the length of the word. </p>
<p>For example playing a two letter word like DO will give you 4 points and playing a 3 letter word like DON will give you 9 points.</p>
<p>Points will only be awarded for a dictionary word.</p>
<p>Points will not be rewarded for a word which has already been played.</p>
<p>You can not pass in two consecutive turns. Doing so will result in forfeiting the game to your opponent.</p>
